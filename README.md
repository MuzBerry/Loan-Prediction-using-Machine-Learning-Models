# Loan-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Models

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be accepted or not based on a dataset of previously approved and rejected loan applications. The project utilized two different classification models to predict loan approval status. These models are:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/burak3ergun/loan-data-set). The dataset contains various features of loan applications, including gender, marital status, income, loan amount, and more. The dataset also includes a label column indicating whether the loan application was approved or rejected.

## Models

The five classification models were used to train and test the loan prediction model. The model with the highest accuracy was chosen as the final model to predict loan approval status.

- **Logistic Regression** is a statistical model that analyzes the relationship between multiple variables and outputs a binary result (yes or no). It is commonly used in predicting categorical outcomes, such as loan approval status.

- **Random Forest** is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. It is commonly used in classification and regression problems and has been shown to be effective in predicting loan approval status.
